The Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) is a platform-independent object-oriented query language defined by JPA. JPQL
is similar to SQL, but operates on objects, attributes and relationships instead of tables and columns.

The Java Persistence query language (JPQL) is used to define searches against persistent entities independent of the
mechanism used to store those entities. As such, JPQL is "portable", and not constrained to any particular data store.
The Java Persistence query language is an extension of the Enterprise JavaBeans query language, EJB QL, adding
operations such as bulk deletes and updates, join operations, aggregates, projections, and subqueries. Furthermore, JPQL
queries can be declared statically in metadata, or can be dynamically built in code

## JPQL Statement Types

A JPQL statement may be

1. a `SELECT` statement, or
2. an `UPDATE` statement,
3. or a `DELETE` statement

In BNF syntax, a query language statement is defined as:

```
QL_statement ::= select_statement | update_statement | delete_statement
```

### JPQL Select Statement

A select statement is a string which consists of the following clauses:

* a `SELECT` clause, which determines the type of the objects or values to be selected;
* a `FROM` clause, which provides declarations that designate the domain to which the expressions specified in the other
  clauses of the query apply;
* an *optional* `WHERE` clause, which may be used to restrict the results that are returned by the query;
* an *optional* `GROUP BY` clause, which allows query results to be aggregated in terms of groups;
* an *optional* `HAVING` clause, which allows filtering over aggregated groups;
* an *optional* `ORDER BY` clause, which may be used to order the results that are returned by the query.

In BNF syntax, a select statement is defined as:

```
select_statement ::= select_clause from_clause [where_clause] [groupby_clause] [having_clause] [orderby_clause]
```

### JPQL Update and Delete Statements

Update and delete statements provide bulk operations over sets of entities. In BNF syntax, these operations are defined
as:

```
update_statement ::= update_clause [where_clause]
delete_statement ::= delete_clause [where_clause
```

## JPQL Abstract Schema Types and Query Domains

The Java Persistence query language is a typed language, and every expression has a type. The type of an expression is
derived from the structure of the expression, the abstract schema types of the identification variable declarations, the
types to which the persistent fields and relationships evaluate, and the types of literals. The abstract schema type of
an entity is derived from the entity class and the metadata information provided by Java language annotations or in the
XML descriptor.

Informally, the abstract schema type of an entity can be characterized as follows:

* For every persistent field or get accessor method (for a persistent property) of the entity class, there is a field
  ("state-field") whose abstract schema type corresponds to that of the field or the result type of the accessor method.
* For every persistent relationship field or get accessor method (for a persistent relationship property) of the entity
  class, there is a field ("association-field") whose type is the abstract schema type of the related entity (or, if the
  relationship is a one-to-many or many-to-many, a collection of such). Abstract schema types are specific to the query
  language data model. **The persistence provider is not required to implement or otherwise materialize an abstract
  schema type**. The domain of a query consists of the abstract schema types of all entities that are defined in the
  same persistence unit. The domain of a query may be restricted by the navigability of the relationships of the entity
  on which it is based. The association-fields of an entity's abstract schema type determine navigability. Using the
  association-fields and their values, a query can select related entities and use their abstract schema types in the
  query.

### JPQL Entity Naming

Entities are designated in query strings by their entity names. The entity name is defined by the name element of the
Entity annotation (or the entity-name XML descriptor element), and defaults to the unqualified name of the entity class.
Entity names are scoped within the persistence unit and must be unique within the persistence unit.

### JPQL Schema Example

This example assumes that the application developer provides several entity classes representing magazines, publishers,
authors, and articles. The abstract schema types for these entities are `Magazine`, `Publisher`, `Author`, and
`Article`.

The entity `Publisher` has a one-to-many relationships with `Magazine`. There is also a one-to-many relationship between
`Magazine` and `Article`. The entity `Article` is related to `Author` in a one-to-one relationship.

Queries to select magazines can be defined by navigating over the association-fields and state-fields defined by
`Magazine` and `Author`. A query to find all magazines that have unpublished articles is as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT mag
FROM Magazine AS mag
JOIN mag.articles AS art
WHERE art.published = FALSE
```

The next query navigates over the association-field authors of the abstract schema type `Magazine` to find articles, and
uses the state-field `published` of `Article` to select those magazines that have at least one article that is
published. Although predefined reserved identifiers, such as `DISTINCT`, `FROM`, `AS`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, and `FALSE`,
appear in upper case in this example, predefined reserved identifiers are case insensitive. The `SELECT` clause of this
example designates the return type of this query to be of type `Magazine`. Because the same persistence unit defines the
abstract persistence schemas of the related entities, the developer can also specify a query over `articles` that
utilizes the abstract schema type for products, and hence the state-fields and association-fields of both the abstract
schema types `Magazine` and `Author`. For example, if the abstract schema type `Author` has a state-field named
`firstName`, a query over `articles` can be specified using this state-field. Such a query might be to find all
magazines that have articles authored by someone with the first name "John".

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT mag
FROM Magazine mag
JOIN mag.articles art JOIN art.author auth WHERE auth.firstName = 'John'
```

Because `Magazine` is related to `Author` by means of the relationships between `Magazine` and `Article` and between
`Article` and `Author`, navigation using the association-fields authors and product is used to express the query. This
query is specified by using the abstract schema name `Magazine`, which designates the abstract schema type over which
the query ranges. The basis for the navigation is provided by the association-fields authors and product of the abstract
schema types `Magazine` and `Article` respectively.

## JPQL FROM Clause and Navigational Declarations

The `FROM` clause of a query defines the domain of the query by declaring identification variables. An identification
variable is an identifier declared in the `FROM` clause of a query. The domain of the query may be constrained by path
expressions. Identification variables designate instances of a particular entity abstract schema type. The `FROM` clause
can contain multiple identification variable declarations separated by a comma (,):

* from_clause ::= FROM identification_variable_declaration {, {identification_variable_declaration | collection_member_declaration}}*
* identification_variable_declaration ::= range_variable_declaration { join | fetch_join }*
* range_variable_declaration ::= abstract_schema_name [AS] identification_variable
* join ::= join_spec join_association_path_expression [AS] identification_variable
* fetch_join ::= join_spec FETCH join_association_path_expression
* join_association_path_expression ::= join_collection_valued_path_expression | join_single_valued_association_path_expression
* join_spec ::= [ LEFT [OUTER] | INNER ] JOIN
* collection_member_declaration ::= IN (collection_valued_path_expression) [AS] identification_variable

### JPQL FROM Identifiers

An identifier is a character sequence of unlimited length. **The character sequence must begin with a Java identifier**
start character, and all other characters must be Java identifier part characters. An identifier start character is any
character for which the method `Character.isJavaIdentifierStart` returns `true`. This includes the underscore (`_`)
character and the dollar-sign (`$`) character. An identifier-part character is any character for which the method
`Character.isJavaIdentifierPart` returns true . The question-mark (`?`) character is reserved for use by the Java
Persistence query language. The following are reserved identifiers:

* `SELECT`
* `FROM`
* `WHERE`
* `UPDATE`
* `DELETE`
* `JOIN`
* `OUTER`
* `INNER`
* `LEFT`
* `GROUP`
* `BY`
* `HAVING`
* `FETCH`
* `DISTINCT`
* `OBJECT`
* `NULL`
* `TRUE`
* `FALSE`
* `NOT`
* `AND`
* `OR`
* `BETWEEN`
* `LIKE`
* `IN`
* `AS`
* `UNKNOWN`
* `EMPTY`
* `MEMBER`
* `OF`
* `IS`
* `AVG`
* `MAX`
* `MIN`
* `SUM`
* `COUNT`
* `ORDER`
* `BY`
* `ASC`
* `DESC`
* `MOD`
* `UPPER`
* `LOWER`
* `TRIM`
* `POSITION`
* `CHARACTER_LENGTH`
* `CHAR_LENGTH`
* `BIT_LENGTH`
* `CURRENT_TIME`
* `CURRENT_DATE`
* `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
* `NEW`
* `EXISTS`
* `ALL`
* `ANY`
* `SOME`

Reserved identifiers are case insensitive. Reserved identifiers must not be used as identification variables. It is
recommended that other SQL reserved words not be used as identification variables in queries, as they may be used as
reserved identifiers in future releases of the specification.

### JPQL Identification Variables

An identification variable is a valid identifier declared in the `FROM` clause of a query. All identification variables
must be declared in the `FROM` clause. Identification variables cannot be declared in other clauses. An identification
variable must not be a reserved identifier or have the same name as any entity in the same persistence unit:
Identification variables are case insensitive. An identification variable evaluates to a value of the type of the
expression used in declaring the variable. For example, consider the previous query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT mag
FROM Magazine mag JOIN mag.articles art JOIN art.author auth
WHERE auth.firstName = 'John'
```

In the `FROM` clause declaration `mag.articles art`, the identification variable `art` evaluates to any `Article` value
directly reachable from `Magazine`. The association-field articles is a collection of instances of the abstract schema
type `Article` and the identification variable `art` refers to an element of this collection. The type of `auth` is the
abstract schema type of `Author`. An identification variable ranges over the abstract schema type of an entity. An
identification variable designates an instance of an entity abstract schema type or an element of a collection of entity
abstract schema type instances. Identification variables are existentially quantified in a query. An identification
variable always designates a reference to a single value. It is declared in one of three ways:

1. in a range variable declaration,
2. in a join clause, or
3. in a collection member declaration.

The identification variable declarations are evaluated from left to right in the `FROM` clause, and an identification
variable declaration can use the result of a preceding identification variable declaration of the query string.

### JPQL Range Declarations

The syntax for declaring an identification variable as a range variable is similar to that of SQL; optionally, it uses
the `AS` keyword:

```
range_variable_declaration ::= abstract_schema_name [AS] identification_variable
```

Range variable declarations allow the developer to designate a "root" for objects which may not be reachable by
navigation. In order to select values by comparing more than one instance of an entity abstract schema type, more than
one identification variable ranging over the abstract schema type is needed in the `FROM` clause.

The following query returns magazines whose prices are greater than the price of magazines published by "Adventure"
publishers. This example illustrates the use of two different identification variables in the `FROM` clause, both of the
abstract schema type `Magazine`. The `SELECT` clause of this query determines that it is the magazines with prices
greater than those of "Adventure" publisher's that are returned.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT mag1
FROM Magazine mag1, Magazine mag2
WHERE mag1.price > mag2.price AND mag2.publisher.name = 'Adventure'
```

### JPQL Path Expressions

**An identification variable followed by the navigation operator (.) and a state-field or association-field is a path
expression.** The type of the path expression is the type computed as the result of navigation; that is, the type of the
state-field or association-field to which the expression navigates. Depending on navigability, a path expression that
leads to an association-field may be further composed. Path expressions can be composed from other path expressions if
the original path expression evaluates to a single-valued type (not a collection) corresponding to an association-field.
**Path-expression navigability is composed using "inner join" semantics. That is, if the value of a non-terminal
association-field in the path expression is `null`, the path is considered to have no value, and does not participate in
the determination of the result**. The syntax for single-valued path expressions and collection-valued path expressions
is as follows:

* single_valued_path_expression ::= state_field_path_expression | single_valued_association_path_expression
* state_field_path_expression ::= {identification_variable | single_valued_association_path_expression}.state_field
* single_valued_association_path_expression ::= identification_variable.{single_valued_association_field.}*single_valued_association_field
* collection_valued_path_expression ::= identification_variable.{single_valued_association_field.}*collection_valued_association_field
* state_field ::= {embedded_class_state_field.}*simple_state_field

A single_valued_association_field is designated by the name of an association-field in a one-to-one or many-to-one
relationship. The type of a single_valued_association_field and thus a single_valued_association_path_expression is the
abstract schema type of the related entity. A collection_valued_association_field is designated by the name of an
association-field in a one-to-many or a many-to-many relationship. The type of a collection_valued_association_field is
a collection of values of the abstract schema type of the related entity. An embedded_class_state_field is designated
by the name of an entity-state field that corresponds to an embedded class. Navigation to a related entity results in a
value of the related entity's abstract schema type.

The evaluation of a path expression terminating in a state-field results in the abstract schema type corresponding to 
the Java type designated by the state-field. It is syntactically illegal to compose a path expression from a path
expression that evaluates to a collection. For example, if `mag` designates `Magazine`, the path expression
`mag.articles.author` is illegal since navigation to authors results in a collection. This case should produce an error
when the query string is verified. To handle such a navigation, an identification variable must be declared in the
`FROM` clause to range over the elements of the articles collection. Another path expression must be used to navigate
over each such element in the `WHERE` clause of the query, as in the following query, which returns all authors that
have any articles in any magazines:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT art.author
FROM Magazine AS mag, IN(mag.articles) art
```

### JPQL Joins

**An [inner join](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join_inner.asp) may be implicitly specified by the use of a 
artesian product in the FROM clause and a join condition in the `WHERE` clause**.

The syntax for explicit join operations is as follows:

* join ::= join_spec join_association_path_expression [AS] identification_variable
* fetch_join ::= join_spec FETCH join_association_path_expression
* join_spec ::= [ [LEFT [OUTER]](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join_left.asp) | INNER ] JOIN
* join_association_path_expression ::= join_collection_valued_path_expression | join_single_valued_association_path_expression

The following inner and outer join operation types are supported.
