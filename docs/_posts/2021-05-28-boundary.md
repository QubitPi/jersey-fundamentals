Software architecture is the art of drawing lines that I call boundaries. Those boundaries separate software elements
from one another, and restrict those on one side from knowing about those on the other. Some of those lines are drawn
very early in a project's life—even before any code is written. Others are drawn much later. Those that are drawn early
are drawn for the purposes of deferring decisions for as long as possible, and of keeping those decisions from polluting
the core business logic.

_**The goal of an architect is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system**_.
What it is that saps this kind of people-power? Coupling—and especially coupling to premature decisions.

## White Lines Do You Draw and When Do You Draw Them?

**You draw lines between things that matter and things that don't**. The GUI doesn't matter to the business rules, so
there should be a line between them. The database doesn't matter to the GUI, so there should be a line between them. The
database doesn't matter to the business rules, so there should be a line between them.

Here is an example:
