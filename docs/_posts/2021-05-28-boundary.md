Software architecture is the art of drawing lines that I call boundaries. Those boundaries separate software elements
from one another, and restrict those on one side from knowing about those on the other. Some of those lines are drawn
very early in a project's life—even before any code is written. Others are drawn much later. Those that are drawn early
are drawn for the purposes of deferring decisions for as long as possible, and of keeping those decisions from polluting
the core business logic.

_**The goal of an architect is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system**_.
What it is that saps this kind of people-power? Coupling—and especially coupling to premature decisions.

## White Lines Do You Draw and When Do You Draw Them?

**You draw lines between things that matter and things that don't**. The GUI doesn't matter to the business rules, so
there should be a line between them. The database doesn't matter to the GUI, so there should be a line between them. The
database doesn't matter to the business rules, so there should be a line between them.

Here is an example:

![boundary-eg.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/boundary-eg.png" | relative_url}})

The "BusinessRules" use the "DatabaseInterface" to load and save data. The "DatabaseAccess" implements the interface and
directs the operation of the actual "Database".

The classes and interfaces in this diagram are symbolic. In a real application, there would be many business rule
classes, many database interface classes, and many database access implementations. All of them, though, would follow
roughly the same pattern.

Where is the boundary line? The boundary is drawn across the inheritance relationship, just below the
"DatabaseInterface"

![boundary-eg-2.png not loaded property]({{ "/assets/img/boundary-eg-2.png" | relative_url}})

Note the two arrows leaving the "DatabaseAccess" class. Those two arrows point away from the "DatabaseAccess" class.
That means that none of these classes knows that the "DatabaseAccess" class exists.

Now let's pull back a bit. We'll look at the component that contains many business rules, and the component that
contains the database and all its access classes
