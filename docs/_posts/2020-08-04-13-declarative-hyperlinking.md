[RESTful APIs must be hypertext-driven](https://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven). JAX-RS
currently offers `UriBuilder` to simplify URI creation but Jersey adds an additional annotation-based alternative that
is described here. 

**This API is currently under development and experimental so it is subject to change at any time.** For this purpose,
final posts shall be available later.
