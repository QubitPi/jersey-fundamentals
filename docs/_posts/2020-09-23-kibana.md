## Install

### Mac

It is a requirement to [install specific version of Kibana](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/kibana) that matches your
Elasticsearch version, otherwise Kibana won't start properly. We will take version 6 as an example in the following
discussions.

To install Kibana 6, execute

    brew install kibana@6

For more information, see https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/kibana

## Using Kibana

### Star Kibana

We need to tell Kibana where our Elasticsearch instance is so that it can connect to it when it starts. To do that,
specify the IP and port of the Elasticsearch instance in the Kibana config file, which should be
`/usr/local/etc/kibana/kibana.yml` on mac. Find a line that looks like `elasticsearch.hosts: [...]` and specify the
IP and port number of the Elasticsearch instance there, For example:
`elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://192.168.0.1:19200"]`. If the Elasticsearch instance requires authentication, locate
`elasticsearch.username` and `elasticsearch.password` and put then authentication info there accordingly.

Now we can start Kibana in the following way

    $ brew services start kibana@6
    ==> Successfully started `kibana@6` (label: homebrew.mxcl.kibana@6)

> Note: Updating config file requires a Kibana reboot, which is done via `brew services restart kibana@6`

When Kibana is up and running, we shall interact with Kibana UI at [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)

### Browsing Data

#### Step 1 - Creating Index

Open up a browser and hit [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)

![Creating Index Example]({{ "/assets/img/creating-index.png" | relative_url}})

Hit "Next step" and click through to create an index

#### Step 2 - Browsing Data

Go to the "Discover" tab on the left side of Kibana UI and you should be able to see the data under the index we just
created:

### Index

#### Deleting Index

Kibana doesn't support deleting index, but we could use its
[REST API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-delete-index.html) to do so

### Stop Kibana

`brew services stop kibana@6`
