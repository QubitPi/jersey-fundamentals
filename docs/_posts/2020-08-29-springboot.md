## Configuration

### Swagger Integration

* [Basics](https://devwithus.com/documenting-spring-boot-rest-api-with-swagger/)

### Binding Mechanism in Spring Boot

The basic binding in Spring Boot is through the combination of `@Configuration` and `@Bean`:
https://howtodoinjava.com/spring-core/spring-configuration-annotation/

#### @Resource vs @Autowired

#### @Value

`@Value` can be used for injecting values into fields in Spring-managed beans, and it **can be applied at the field or
constructor/method parameter level**.

A **property file** is needed in order to define the values we want to inject with the `@Value` annotation. We annotate
a Spring config class with **`@PropertySource`**, with the properties file name, to specify the path of the property
file. For example:

```java
@Component
@PropertySource("classpath:values.properties")
public class PriorityProvider {
 
    private String priority;
 
    @Autowired
    public PriorityProvider(@Value("${property.qualifier.prefix.property}") String priority) {
        this.priority = priority;
    }
 
    // standard getter
}
```

!!! note "`application.properties` - the Default Property File"
    Boot applies its typical convention over configuration approach to property files. This means that we can simply put
    an application.properties file in our `src/main/resources directory`, and it will be auto-detected. We can then
    inject any loaded properties from it as normal.
    
    Using this default file, we don't have to explicitly register a `PropertySource` or even provide a path to a
    property file.
    
##### `@Value` with Enum

We can use enum with `@Value` annotation. A field or constructor parameter can be injected with enum value using
`@Value` annotation. For example, suppose we have an Enum class of

```java
public enum Fruit {
    APPLE,
    ORANGE,
    BANANA
}
```

and a property being picked up at runtime: 

```properties
market.fruit.bestseller = BANANA
```

We could inject value to an enum field using

```java
@Component
public class Foo {
    
    private final Fruit fruit;
    
    @Autowired
    public Foo(@Value("${market.fruit.bestseller}") Fruit fruit) {
        this.fruit = fruit;
    }
}
```

### What is `applicationContext.xml` file?

`applicationContext.xml` is effectively the same thing as `web.xml`. This file should be placed as
`/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml` under `resource` directory.

Spring 3 MVC accessing HttpRequest from controller

Spring MVC will give you the HttpRequest if you just add it to your controller method signature:

For instance:

```java
/**
 * Generate a PDF report...
 */
@RequestMapping(value = "/report/{objectId}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public @ResponseBody void generateReport(
        @PathVariable("objectId") Long objectId,
        HttpServletRequest request,
        HttpServletResponse response
) {

    // ...
    // Here you can use the request and response objects like:
    // response.setContentType("application/pdf");
    // response.getOutputStream().write(...);

}
```

As you see, simply adding the `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse` objects to the signature makes Spring
MVC to pass those objects to your controller method. You'll want the `HttpSession` object too.

It is strongly recommended to have a look at the list of supported arguments that Spring MVC is able to auto-magically
inject to your handler methods:
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-ann-arguments

### Logging

#### Use Default Logging Pattern

Once you have included the default configuration, you can use its values in your own logback-spring.xml configuration:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration scan="true">
    <!-- use Spring default values -->
    <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/defaults.xml"/>

    <appender name="CONSOLE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder>
            <pattern>${CONSOLE_LOG_PATTERN}</pattern>
            <charset>utf8</charset>
        </encoder>
    </appender>
    ‚Ä¶
</configuration>
```

## Spring Data JPA

### Interface-based Projection

Suppose we need to need to search for a person's profile as well as the number of vehicles that person owns. Those
information would normally be kept in 2 tables, A "Person" table and a "Vehicle" table. A JOIN would be required. We
could

* Issue a single query and parse the *un-typed* result in memory, or
* Issue 2 queries to the "Person" and "Vehicle" tables and JOIN the *typed* query results in memory

The trade-off between type-safe and single-roundtrip query is obvious here. Is there an approach that allows us to
obtain typed query result in a single roundtrip? Yes, and the answer is interface-based projection:

#### Step 1 - Define Custom DB Query Result Type

```java
public class PersonWithNumVehicles {

    Long getSsn();
    Date getBirthDate();
    int getVehicleCount();
}
```

#### Step 2 - Write Annotated Spring Data JPA Query

```java
@NotNull
@Query(
        value = "SELECT person.ssn AS ssn, "
                    + "person.name AS name, "
                    + "person.birthDate AS birthDate, "
                    + "COUNT(Vehicle.vinNumber) AS vehicleCount "
                + "FROM Person person, "
                    + "Vehicle vehicle "
                + "WHERE person.ssn = vehicle.ownerId AND "
                    + "person.ssn = 345215674 AND "
                + "GROUP BY person.ssn"
)
PersonWithNumVehicles getPersonWithVehicleInfoBySsn(
        @NotNull @Param("ssn") Long ssn,
        @NotNull Pageable pagination
);
```

> üìã Note that `person` is the physical table name.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The return type of `PersonWithNumVehicles.getVehicleCount()` must be `int` because it is calculated using SQL
`COUNT()` function. Using other types, such as `Long` will silently fail the query.

### [`@Query`](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-data-jpa-query)

Spring Data provides many ways to define a query that we can execute. One of these is the` @Query` annotation. In this
section, we'll demonstrate how to use the `@Query` annotation in Spring Data JPA to execute both JPQL and native SQL
queries. We'll also show how to build a dynamic query when the @Query annotation is not enough.
         
In order to define SQL to execute for a Spring Data repository method, we can annotate the method with the `@Query`
annotation - its `value` attribute contains the JPQL or SQL to execute.

The `@Query` annotation takes precedence over named queries, which are annotated with `@NamedQuery` or defined in an
`orm.xml` file. (It's a good approach to place a query definition just above the method inside the repository rather
than inside our domain model as named queries. The repository is responsible for persistence, so it's a better place to
store these definitions.)

#### JPQL

**By default, the query definition uses JPQL.**

Let's look at a simple repository method that returns active User entities from the database:

```java
@Query("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.status = 1")
Collection<User> findAllActiveUsers();
```

#### Native

We can use also native SQL to define our query. All we have to do is set the value of the nativeQuery attribute to true
and define the native SQL query in the value attribute of the annotation:

```java
@Query(
        nativeQuery = true,
        value = "SELECT * FROM USERS u WHERE u.status = 1"
)
Collection<User> findAllActiveUsersNative();
```

#### Define Order in a Query

We can pass an additional parameter of type `Sort` to a Spring Data method declaration that has the `@Query` annotation.
It'll be translated into the ORDER BY clause that gets passed to the database.

##### Sorting for JPA Provided and Derived Methods

For the methods we get out of the box such as `findAll(Sort)` or the ones that are generated by parsing method
signatures, we can only use object properties to define our sort:

```java
userRepository.findAll(Sort.by(Sort.Direction.ASC, "name"));
```

Now imagine that we want to sort by the length of a name property:

```java
userRepository.findAll(Sort.by("LENGTH(name)"));
```

When we execute the above code, we'll receive an exception:

```
org.springframework.data.mapping.PropertyReferenceException: No property LENGTH(name) found for type User!
```

##### JPQL

When we use JPQL for a query definition, then Spring Data can handle sorting without any problem - all we have to do is
add a method parameter of type Sort:

```java
@Query(value = "SELECT u FROM User u")
List<User> findAllUsers(Sort sort);
```

We can call this method and pass a `Sort` parameter, which will order the result by the name property of the `User`
object:

```java
userRepository.findAllUsers(Sort.by("name"));
```

And because we used the `@Query` annotation, we can use the same method to get the sorted list of `Users` by the length
of their names:

```
userRepository.findAllUsers(JpaSort.unsafe("LENGTH(name)"));
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It's crucial that we use `JpaSort.unsafe()` to create a `Sort` object instance. When we use
> `Sort.by("LENGTH(name)");` then we'll receive exactly the same exception as we saw above for the `findAll()` method.
> When Spring Data discovers the unsafe `Sort` order for a method that uses the `@Query` annotation, then it just
> appends the sort clause to the query - it skips checking whether the property to sort by belongs to the domain model.
    
##### Native

When the `@Query` annotation uses native SQL, then it's not possible to define a `Sort`. If we do, we'll receive an
exception:

```
org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.query.InvalidJpaQueryMethodException: 
Cannot use native queries with dynamic sorting and/or pagination
```

As the exception says, the sort isn't supported for native queries. The error message gives us a hint that pagination
will cause an exception too.                                                                              

However, there is a [workaround that enables pagination](#native-2)

#### Pagination

Pagination allows us to return just a subset of a whole result in a Page. This is useful, for example, when navigating
through several pages of data on a web page.

Another advantage of pagination is that the amount of data sent from server to client is minimized. By sending smaller
pieces of data, we can generally see an improvement in performance.

##### JPQL

Using pagination in the JPQL query definition is straightforward:

```java
@Query(value = "SELECT u FROM User u ORDER BY id")
Page<User> findAllUsersWithPagination(Pageable pageable);
```

We can pass a `PageRequest` parameter to get a page of data.

Pagination is also supported for native queries but requires a little bit of additional work.

##### Native

We can enable pagination for native queries by declaring an additional attribute `countQuery`.

This defines the SQL to execute to count the number of rows in the whole result:

```java
@Query(
    value = "SELECT * FROM Users ORDER BY id", 
    countQuery = "SELECT count(*) FROM Users", 
    nativeQuery = true
)
Page<User> findAllUsersWithPagination(Pageable pageable);
```

#### Query Parameters

##### JPQL

We use the `@Param` annotation in the method declaration to match parameters defined by name in JPQL with parameters
from the method declaration:

```java
@Query("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.status = :status and u.name = :name")
User findUserByStatusAndNameNamedParams(
    @Param("status") Integer status, 
    @Param("name") String name
);
```

Note that in the above example, we defined our SQL query and method parameters to have the same names, but it's not
required as long as the value strings are the same:

```java
@Query("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.status = :status and u.name = :name")
User findUserByUserStatusAndUserName(
    @Param("status") Integer userStatus, 
    @Param("name") String userName
);
```

##### Native

For the native query definition, there is no difference in how we pass a parameter via the name to the query in
comparison to JPQL - we use the @Param annotation:

```java
@Query(value = "SELECT * FROM Users u WHERE u.status = :status and u.name = :name", 
  nativeQuery = true)
User findUserByStatusAndNameNamedParamsNative(
  @Param("status") Integer status, @Param("name") String name);
```

#### Collection Parameter

Let's consider the case when the where clause of our JPQL or SQL query contains the `IN` (or `NOT IN`) keyword:

```java
SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.name IN :names
```

In this case, we can define a query method that takes Collection as a parameter:

```java
@Query(value = "SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.name IN :names")
List<User> findUserByNameList(@Param("names") Collection<String> names);
```

As the parameter is a Collection, it can be used with List, HashSet, etc.

#### Update Queries With `@Modifying`

We can use the `@Query` annotation to modify the state of the database by also adding the `@Modifying` annotation to the
repository method.

##### JPQL

The repository method that modifies the data has two differences in comparison to the select query - it has the
`@Modifying` annotation and, of course, the JPQL query uses update instead of select:

```java
@Modifying
@Query("update User u set u.status = :status where u.name = :name")
int updateUserSetStatusForName(
    @Param("status") Integer status, 
    @Param("name") String name
);
```

The return value defines how many rows the execution of the query updated. Both indexed and named parameters can be used
inside update queries.

##### Inserts

To perform an insert operation, we have to both apply `@Modifying` and use a **native query** since `INSERT` is not a
part of the JPA interface:

```java
@Modifying
@Query(
    value = "insert into Users (name, age, email, status) values (:name, :age, :email, :status)",
    nativeQuery = true
)
void insertUser(
    @Param("name") String name,
    @Param("age") Integer age, 
    @Param("status") Integer status,
    @Param("email") String email);
```

### Pagination

[Pageable](https://www.logicbig.com/tutorials/spring-framework/spring-data/web-support-with-pageable-argument-resolver.html)

#### Generate a Creation Date-Time Automatically

##### JPA

There isn't anything as convenient as annotating the Timestamp field directly, but you could use the `@PrePersist`,
`@PreUpdate` annotations and with little effort achieve the same results.

##### Hibernate

[`@CreationTimestamp`](http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/current/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#mapping-generated-CreationTimestamp)
[`@UpdateTimestamp`](http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/current/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#mapping-generated-UpdateTimestamp)

##### Spring Data JPA

[`@CreatedDate`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#auditing.annotations)
[`@LastModifiedDate`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#auditing.annotations)

### [Map the Native Query Result to Non-Entity POJO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48296588)

Let's say we have a TODO app with a database that keeps information about TODO task (`todo_task` table) and person
(`person`). We would like to get a list of Person's ongoing TODO's; the results should have at least 2 columns - task
name and person's name. We could use the following query:

```
SELECT todo_task.id, todo_task.task_name, person.name
FROM todo_task
LEFT JOIN person ON todo_task.person_id = person.id
WHERE todo_task.task_status NOT IN ('DONE', 'TO DO')
```

We notice that the result comes with 3 columns that map to 2 separate JPA entities, i.e. `todo_task` & `person`

In order to map the database result to a strongly typed programmable object, the easiest way is to use so called
[projection](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#projections). It can map query results
to interfaces. Using `SqlResultSetMapping` is inconvienient and makes your code ugly :).

```java
@Query(
        nativeQuery = true,
        value = "SELECT todo_task.id AS id, todo_task.task_name AS taskName, person.name AS name " +
                "FROM todo_task " +
                "LEFT JOIN person ON todo_task.person_id = person.id " +
                "WHERE todo_task.task_status NOT IN ('Finished', 'Canceled')"
)
@NotNull
List<Task> getAllTasks(@NotNull Pageable pagination);
```

```java
public interface Task {

    Long getId();

    String getTaskName();
    
    String getName();
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you use `SELECT table.column ...` notation always define aliases matching names from entity(`Task`). For example
> this won't work properly (projection will return nulls(`NullPointerException: null` at runtime) for each getter):
> `SELECT todo_task.id, todo_task.task_name, person.name FROM ...` But this works fine:
> `SELECT todo_task.id AS id, todo_task.task_name AS taskName, person.name AS name FROM ...`

## Testing

### Integration Tests with `@SpringBootTest`

With the `@SpringBootTest` annotation, Spring Boot provides a convenient way to start up an application context to be
used in a test.

### Integration Tests vs. Unit Tests

Before we start into integration tests with Spring Boot, let's define what sets an integration test apart from a unit
test.

A unit test covers a single "unit", where a unit commonly is a single class, but can also be a cluster of cohesive
classes that is tested in combination.

An integration test can be any of the following:

- a test that covers multiple "units". It tests the interaction between two or more clusters of cohesive classes.
- a test that covers multiple layers. This is actually a specialization of the first case and might cover the
  interaction between a business service and the persistence layer, for instance.
- a test that covers the whole path through the application. In these tests, we send a request to the application and
  check that it responds correctly and has changed the database state according to our expectations.

Spring Boot provides the `@SpringBootTest` annotation which we can use to create an application context containing all
the objects we need for all of the above test types. Note, however, that overusing `@SpringBootTest` might lead to
very long-running test suites.

So, for simple tests that cover multiple units we should rather create plain tests, very similar to unit tests, in which
we manually create the object graph needed for the test and mock away the rest. This way, Spring doesn't fire up a whole
application context each time the test is started.

For tests that cover integration with the web layer or persistence layer, we can use
[@WebMvcTest](https://reflectoring.io/spring-boot-web-controller-test/) or
[@DataJpaTest](https://reflectoring.io/spring-boot-data-jpa-test/) instead. For integration with other layers, have a
look at Spring Boot's other
[test slice annotations](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/appendix-test-auto-configuration.html).
Note that these test slices will also take some time to boot up, though.

Finally, for tests that cover the whole Spring Boot application from incoming request to database, or tests that cover
certain parts of the application that are hard to set up manually, we can and should use `@SpringBootTest`

### Creating an ApplicationContext with `@SpringBootTest`

`@SpringBootTest` by default starts searching in the current package of the test class and then searches upwards through
the package structure, looking for a class annotated with `@SpringBootConfiguration` from which it then reads the
configuration to create an application context. This class is usually our main application class since the
`@SpringBootApplication` annotation includes the `@SpringBootConfiguration` annotation. It then creates an application
context very similar to the one that would be started in a production environment.

Because we have a full application context, including web controllers, Spring Data repositories, and data sources,
`@SpringBootTest` is very convenient for integration tests that go through all layers of the application:

```java
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
class RegisterUseCaseIntegrationTest {

    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;

    @Autowired
    private ObjectMapper objectMapper;

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Test
    void registrationWorksThroughAllLayers() throws Exception {
        UserResource user = new UserResource("Zaphod", "zaphod@galaxy.net");

        mockMvc.perform(post("/forums/{forumId}/register", 42L)
                .contentType("application/json")
                .param("sendWelcomeMail", "true")
                .content(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(user)))
                .andExpect(status().isOk());

        UserEntity userEntity = userRepository.findByName("Zaphod");
        assertThat(userEntity.getEmail()).isEqualTo("zaphod@galaxy.net");
    }

}
```

Here, we additionally use `@AutoConfigureMockMvc` to add a `MockMvc` instance to the application context.

We use this `MockMvc` object to perform a `POST` request to our application and to verify that it responds as expected.

We then use the `UserRepository` from the application context to verify that the request has lead to an expected change
in the state of the database.

### Customizing the Application Context

We can turn a lot of knobs to customize the application context created by `@SpringBootTest`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Each customization of the application context is one more thing that makes it different from the "real" application
> context that is started up in a production setting. So, in order to make our tests as close to production as we can,
> **we should only customize what's really necessary to get the tests running**!

#### Setting Custom Configuration Properties

Often, in tests it's necessary to set some configuration properties to a value that's different from the value in a
production setting:

```java
@SpringBootTest(properties = "foo=bar")
class SpringBootPropertiesTest {

    @Value("${foo}")
    String foo;

    @Test
    void test(){
        assertThat(foo).isEqualTo("bar");
    }
}
```

If the property `foo` exists in the default setting, it will be overridden by the value `bar` for this test.

### Externalizing Properties with `@ActiveProfiles`

If many of our tests need the same set of properties, we can create a configuration file
`application-<profile>.properties` or `application-<profile>.yml` and load the properties from that file by
activating a certain profile::

    ## application-test.yml
    foo: bar

```java
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
class SpringBootProfileTest {

    @Value("${foo}")
    String foo;

    @Test
    void test(){
        assertThat(foo).isEqualTo("bar");
    }
}
```

One can also use
[@PropertySource](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/PropertySource.html)
annotation to achieve the same goal.

Yet another way to customize a whole set of properties is with the `@TestPropertySource` annotation::

    ## src/test/resources/foo.properties
    foo=bar

```java
@SpringBootTest
@TestPropertySource(locations = "/foo.properties")
class SpringBootPropertySourceTest {

    @Value("${foo}")
    String foo;

    @Test
    void test(){
        assertThat(foo).isEqualTo("bar");
    }
}
```

In addition, we can also use
[@ContextConfiguration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/ContextConfiguration.html),
which is a very similar mechanism for specifying test class properties.

#### Injecting Mocks with `@MockBean`

If we only want to test a certain part of the application instead of the whole path from incoming request to database,
we can replace certain beans in the application context by using `@MockBean`:

```java
@SpringBootTest
class MockBeanTest {

    @MockBean
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Autowired
    private RegisterUseCase registerUseCase;

    @Test
    void testRegister(){
        // given
        User user = new User("Zaphod", "zaphod@galaxy.net");
        boolean sendWelcomeMail = true;
        given(userRepository.save(any(UserEntity.class))).willReturn(userEntity(1L));

        // when
        Long userId = registerUseCase.registerUser(user, sendWelcomeMail);

        // then
        assertThat(userId).isEqualTo(1L);
    }
}
```

In this case, we have replaced the `UserRepository` bean with a mock. Using Mockito's `when` method, we have
specified the expected behavior for this mock in order to test a class that uses this repository.

#### Adding Beans with `@Import`

If certain beans are not included in the default application context, but we need them in a test, we can import them
using the `@Import` annotation:

```java
package other.namespace;

@Component
public class Foo {

}
```

```java
@SpringBootTest
@Import(other.namespace.Foo.class)
class SpringBootImportTest {

    @Autowired
    Foo foo;

    @Test
    void test() {
        assertThat(foo).isNotNull();
    }
}
```

#### Creating a Custom `@SpringBootApplication`

We can even create a whole custom Spring Boot application to start up in tests. If this application class is in the same
package as the real application class, but in the test sources rather than the production sources, `@SpringBootTest`
will find it before the actual application class and load the application context from this application instead.

Alternatively, we can tell Spring Boot which application class to use to create an application context:

```java
@SpringBootTest(classes = CustomApplication.class)
class CustomApplicationTest {

}
```

When doing this, however, we are **testing an application context that may be completely different from the production
environment**, so this should be a last resort only when the production application cannot be started in a test
environment. Usually, there are better ways, though, such as to make the real application context configurable to
exclude beans that will not start in a test environment. Let's look at this in an example.

Let's say we use the `@EnableScheduling` annotation on our application class. Each time the application context is
started (even in tests), all `@Scheduled` jobs will be started and may conflict with our tests. We usually don't want
the jobs to run in tests, so we can create a second application class without the `@EnabledScheduling` annotation and
use this in the tests. However, the better solution would be to create a configuration class that can be toggled with a
property:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableScheduling
@ConditionalOnProperty(
        name = "io.reflectoring.scheduling.enabled",
        havingValue = "true",
        matchIfMissing = true
)
public class SchedulingConfiguration {

}
```

We have moved the `@EnableScheduling` annotation from our application class to this special confgiuration class.
Setting the property `io.reflectoring.scheduling.enabled` to `false` will cause this class not to be loaded as part
of the application context:

```java
@SpringBootTest(properties = "io.reflectoring.scheduling.enabled=false")
class SchedulingTest {

    @Autowired(required = false)
    private SchedulingConfiguration schedulingConfiguration;

    @Test
    void test() {
        assertThat(schedulingConfiguration).isNull();
    }
}
```

We have now successfully deactivated the scheduled jobs in the tests.

### IT Design

A code base with a lot of `@SpringBootTest`-annotated tests may take quite some time to run. The Spring test support
is smart enough to only create an application context once and re-use it in following tests, but if different tests need
different application contexts, it will still create a separate context for each test, which takes some time for each
test.

All of the customizing options described above will cause Spring to create a new application context. So, we might want
to create one single configuration and use it for all tests so that the application context can be re-used.

#### Pre-configure End-Object in End-to-End Integration Test

The name of this section might sound confusing to you, so let me explian what I meant by starting with an example:

You wrote a Spring Boot application. This app has a `MusicController` that gives you all information about your
personal music library. The `MusicController` is, by convension, backed by a `MusicService`, to which
`MusicController` delegates all user requests.

In order to improve the performance, you add a "caching layer" behind the `MusicService`; let's call the cache
"`MusicCache`". The facilitate our discussion, we will assume the cache is simply a Java `Map` whose key is
`musicId` and value is a `Music` Object.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/")
public class MetaManagerController {

    @Autowired
    private MusicService musicService;

    @RequestMapping(value="music/{musicId}", method=RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<Music> getMusicInfo(@PathVariable("musicId") String musicId) {
        return getMusicService().getById(musicId);
    }

    private MusicService getMusicService() {
        return musicService;
    }
}
```

For **demonstration** purpose, let's put `MusicCache` as a public field in `MusicService` (don't do this in
production!):

```java
public class MusicService {

    @Autowired
    private MusicCache musicCache;

    ...

    public getById(String musicId) {
        return getMusicCache().get(musicId);
    }

    private MusicCache getMusicCache() {
        return cache;
    }
}
```

Now you are writing integration test against `MusicController` and you would like to pre-insert some cache. The
approach is the following (In your test code):

```java
ServletContext servletContext = webApplicationContext.getServletContext();

MusicCache musicCache = webApplicationContext.getBean("musicCache");
musicCache.put("id1", testMusicObject1);
musicCache.put("id2", testMusicObject2);

String responseData = mockMvc.perform(get("/music/id1"))
            .andExpect(status().isOk())
            .andReturn()
            .getResponse().getContentAsString();

// veriry "responseData" has expected testMusicObject1
```

## FAQ

### Why Does My Spring Boot App Always Shutdown Immediately After Starting?

Suppose you have a spring boot project that packages to a JAR called `app.jar`. Running

    java -jar .../app.jar
    
succeeds but terminates immediately so that no apps are ending up running. This means the app is not a webapp because it
doesn't have an embedded container (e.g. Tomcat) on the classpath. Adding one fixed it. If you are using Maven, then add
this in `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### Inject Headers Info

#### Accessing HTTP Headers

##### Individual Headers

If we need access to a specific header, we can configure `@RequestHeader` with the header name:

```java
@GetMapping("/greeting")
public ResponseEntity<String> greeting(@RequestHeader("accept-language") String language) {
    ...
}
```

Then, we can access the value using the variable passed into our method. If a header named "accept-language" isn't found
in the request, the method returns a "400 Bad Request" error.

Our headers don't have to be strings. For example, if we know our header is a number, we can declare our variable as a
numeric type:

```java
@GetMapping("/double")
public ResponseEntity<String> doubleNumber(@RequestHeader("my-number") int myNumber) {
    return new ResponseEntity<String>(String.format("%d * 2 = %d", myNumber, (myNumber * 2)), HttpStatus.OK);
}
```

##### All Headers

If we're not sure which headers will be present, or we need more of them than we want in our method's signature, we can
use the `@RequestHeader` annotation without a specific name.

We have a few choices for our variable type:

* `Map`
* `MultiValueMap`
* `HttpHeaders`

First, let's get the request headers as a Map:

```java
@GetMapping("/listHeaders")
public ResponseEntity<String> listAllHeaders(@RequestHeader Map<String, String> headers) {
    ...
}
```

If we use a `Map` and one of the headers has more than one value, we'll get only the first value. This is the equivalent
of using the `getFirst` method on a `MultiValueMap`.

If our headers may have multiple values, we can get them as a `MultiValueMap`:

```java
@GetMapping("/multiValue")
public ResponseEntity<String> multiValue(
  @RequestHeader MultiValueMap<String, String> headers) {
    headers.forEach((key, value) -> {
        LOG.info(String.format(
          "Header '%s' = %s", key, value.stream().collect(Collectors.joining("|"))));
    });
        
    return new ResponseEntity<String>(
      String.format("Listed %d headers", headers.size()), HttpStatus.OK);
}
```
