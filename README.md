# A Complete Jersey Guide Book

July 22nd, 2020 was a great day for me, a good day when I left a truly horrible company, Tencent, which cares nothing
about its employees and had me experienced the darkest period of my life(I'm saying any reasonably-minded people will
hate working there). I was very happy about the decision (even now~) and I told myself: "Tomorrow is a reload to a new
and incredible journey~" ðŸ˜‰

July 23rd, 2020 was my birthday. It was a new day of a lot wonderful things happened. One of them is my come-back
initiative of keep learning intensively. I love learning and making learning an art process; and I love Jersey, too,
which brings to this work - [The Complete Jersey Guide Book](https://qubitpi.github.io/jersey-fundamentals/), a crystal
of my experience and love with Jersey technology.

I definitely love using Jersey. I believe Jersey is good and I hope this book could also do something good for you,
whether you are the beginner or someone looking for a reference of Jersey, you will love it :)
