# [A Complete Jersey Guide Book](https://qubitpi.github.io/jersey-guide/)

I was reading a very nicely-written book the other day, called
"[The Back of the Napkin: Solving Problems and Selling Ideas with Pictures](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2420301.The_Back_of_the_Napkin)".

It begun with a problem of "lots of people these days are very confused about how to create a useful Web site". With
some interesting naratives there came a little beautiful napkin-picture as a solution from the book:

It doesn't look little but that's something you should talk about with a computer screen engineer the other day, but the
point is this - I was truly attracted by this napkin-picture idea and I'd like to put this idea into practice; so here
came to this [Jersey Guide](https://qubitpi.github.io/jersey-guide/), which I think it's an absolutely wonderful guide.
Jersy has been an industry standard for standing up Webservices; I love it; and you shall find it pretty useful
to learn and play with, believe me~
